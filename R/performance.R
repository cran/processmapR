#' @title Performance map profile
#' @description Function to create a performance map profile to be used as the type of a process map. It results in a process map describing process time.
#' @param FUN A summary function to be called on the process time of a specific activity, e.g. mean, median, min, max
#' @param units The time unit in which processing time should be presented (mins, hours, days, weeks)
#' @param flow_time The time to depict on the flows: the inter start time is the time between the start timestamp of consecutive activity instances,
#' the idle time is the time between the end and start time of consecutive activity instances.
#' @export performance
