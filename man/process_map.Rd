\usage{
process_map(eventlog, type = frequency("absolute"), type_nodes = type,
  type_edges = type, render = T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The event log object for which to create a process map}

\item{type}{A process map type, which can be created with the functions frequency and performance. The first type focusses on the frequency aspect of a process, while the second one focussed on processing time.}

\item{type_nodes}{A process map type to be used for nodes only, which can be created with the functions frequency and performance. The first type focusses on the frequency aspect of a process, while the second one focussed on processing time.}

\item{type_edges}{A process map type to be used for edges only, which can be created with the functions frequency and performance. The first type focusses on the frequency aspect of a process, while the second one focussed on processing time.}

\item{render}{Whether the map should be rendered immediately (default), or rather an object of type dgr_graph should be returned.}

\item{...}{Deprecated arguments}
